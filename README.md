This project's task was to design and simulate enemy strategies in a rogue-like retro game using Java. The goal was to create an engaging gaming experience by implementing logic for enemy movements within the game environment.

The primary focus of the project was to improve our grasp on the SOLID principles while developing a system for enemy movements, contributing to the overall dynamics of the retro game.
